# Natural-Scene-Simulation-using-Opengl-

<h1> BRIEF DESCRIPTION </h1>
The simulation of natural scenes is a very important branch of
Computer Graphics and has broad application fields. The main
idea is to simulate a real-world natural scene, by drawing island,
trees, grass and simulate the daylight, water movement and surround the world with a realistic skybox and some special effects like: fog, snow falling, … etc.


<h1> REQUIREMENTS</h1>
<h2 > [SkyBox]</h2>

Draw a skybox with a realistic 6 textures one for each face of the cube.
<h2>[Terrain]</h2>
Given any height map draw a multi-texture terrain to simulate the island.
<h2> [Light]</h2> Simulate both the day and night light.
<h2> [Trees and Grass]</h2>
Draw 3D tree models in random locations of the terrain and draw
billboards with grass texture in different locations.
<h2> [Water] </h2> Simulate the sea motion.
<h2> [Special effect]</h2> Apply Fog effect.
<h2> [Camera]</h2>
Implement First Person Camera that can walk on the surface of the
terrain accurately.
<h2> [Tour]</h2>
By pressing a certain key, allow the camera to take a tour around the
scene automatically.
BONUS
[Sound effect] add sound the simulate the sound of beach & water.
[Special effects] add much complicated effects like snow, rain, … etc.
[Water effect] add reflection & refraction to water.
[Save & Load Scene] add option to save an entire scene and loading it.
[Human] add animated 3D human model and implement 3rd person
camera to follow the human in the scene.
